## Why

[THIS!](https://twitter.com/SubinSiby/status/1264340589367029760)

Case 1: I want to share files with my friend's phone or computer, but we don't have a USB cable. I have a file sharing app A, my friend have B. Both of us argue "A is better", "No, B is better". The app installation size is 50MB, is half bloatware and the arguing cost us 15 minutes. If it's an iPhone & an Android, ohnooooo. Bonus: iPhone + Android + Windows PC together ðŸ™‚

Case 2: I want to copy a text from my phone to computer, arghhðŸ˜« I have to open WhatsApp Web/Telegram now, send a message to myself -_- ðŸ˜’

Both the above problems are solved with [WebDrop](https://WebDrop.Space). Simply open the website on any number of your devices (even simultaneously) and share files & messages !

### Development

- `yarn install`
- `yarn serve`
- `run replit`

Clone the repo and do :

```
yarn install
yarn start
```

WebTorrent trackers list is included in `src/main.ts`. You may want to change that or add/start your [own tracker](https://github.com/subins2000/p2pt/blob/master/startTracker.js) locally for development.

File is shared via streams using [simple-peer-files library](https://github.com/subins2000/simple-peer-files).

#### Starting Local Tracker

Install [bittorrent-tracker] globally :

```
yarn global add bittorrent-tracker
```

Download [this script](https://github.com/subins2000/p2pt/blob/master/startTracker.js) and run it. It only requires `bittorrent-tracker`.
